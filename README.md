  <p>
    Avian carriers can provide high delay, low throughput, and low altitude
    service. The connection topology is limited to a single point-to-point path
    for each carrier, used with standard carriers, but many carriers can be used
    without significant interference with each other, outside early spring. This
    is because of the 3D ether space available to the carriers, in contrast to
    the 1D ether used by IEEE802.3. The carriers have an intrinsic collision
    avoidance system, which increases availability.
